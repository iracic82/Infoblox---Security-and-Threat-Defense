# Overview

The integration of Generative AI into healthcare workflows is rapidly accelerating. Doctors, clinicians, and researchers are using AI to:
 - Summarize clinical notes
 - Draft care plans
 - Analyze symptoms or diagnostics

However, this also introduces new risk vectors ‚Äî including uncontrolled DNS traffic, third-party API usage, and exposure to unvetted data sources.

# Use Case Story: Dr. Claire

Meet Dr. Claire, a busy pediatrician. She uses an internal web-based assistant to:
 - Ask medical questions like ‚ÄúWhat are common asthma triggers in children?‚Äù
 - Upload notes for summarization
 - Pull references from drug or symptom databases

Behind the scenes, this app uses AWS Bedrock with Claude to generate intelligent responses.

But there‚Äôs a hidden challenge:
 - What happens when the app tries to resolve domains like `ai-medicine-data.info`?
 - Or connects to third-party APIs over DNS?
 - Or leaks sensitive lookup patterns?

This is where Infoblox DNS Security plays a critical role.

# DNS Security for GenAI

Even in secure cloud environments, AI apps and LLMs introduce DNS-layer activity:
 - Flask-based apps resolve endpoints like `bedrock-runtime.amazonaws.com`
 - LLM responses often include external medical URLs
 - Optional third-party lookups may target unapproved or risky domains

Infoblox Threat Defense provides:
 - Allow-lists and domain policy control
 - Detection of suspicious DNS behavior (e.g., entropy, volume, or tunneling)
 - Real-time enforcement (RPZ, TIDE-based blocking)


# Business Value

Without DNS-layer enforcement, GenAI apps are opaque and vulnerable.
 With Infoblox:
 - Security teams gain real-time visibility and control
 - AI access is restricted to approved sources
 - Threats like DNS tunneling, data leaks, or typosquatting are neutralized
 - AI adoption becomes safe and compliant in regulated sectors like healthcare



> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NOTE:** This environment is *real*! AWS Cloud Accounts have been created for each student. No bitcoin mining, please! :)

In this section we will:
1) Review the cloud architecture
2) Login to your cloud account console's
3) Deploy resources onto your cloud regions
4) Create your Infoblox Portal user




---

## 1) Review Cloud Architecture
===

First lets review the cloud architecture that has been provision for your Infoblox Lab experience.

Navigate to the *Lab Diagram* tab above and review the diagram. This is what we're building today!




## 2) Login to your cloud account consoles
===
Using the credentials below, login to the AWS and Azure Web Consoles in their respective tabs above:

---
# AWS Credentials ‚òÅÔ∏è

Select "IAM Account" and enter the **AWS ID**:
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_ACCOUNT_ID" hostname="shell" ]]
```

**AWS Username**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_USERNAME" hostname="shell" ]]
```

**AWS Password**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_PASSWORD" hostname="shell" ]]
```



## 3) Deploy resources onto your cloud regions
===

Now that you've logged into the cloud providers consoles its time to deploy resources for upcoming Instruqt Challenges:

### 1. Deploy AWS resources in EU

Apply the resources:

```run
cd ~/infoblox-lab/secure-ai-infoblox/terraform
terraform apply --auto-approve  -target=module.aws__instances_eu
```

## 4) Enable Amazon Bedrock Model Access in AWS Console
===

‚úÖ Goal:

Grant access to the amazon.titan-text-lite-v1 model in the eu-west-2 region so your app or CLI calls can work without errors.


üü¢ Step-by-Step Instructions

1.	Login to AWS Console

Go to:
üëâ https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=eu-west-2

2.	Check Region
Make sure the region in the top-right corner is set to:
EU (Ireland) / eu-west-2

3.	Go to ‚ÄúModel access‚Äù section
In the left sidebar, click:
‚ÄúModel access‚Äù
4.	Click ‚ÄúManage model access‚Äù (blue button, top-right)
5.	Find ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù under Providers
Look for the Amazon Titan family
‚úÖ Check the box next to amazon.titan-text-lite
6.	Scroll to the bottom and click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù


## 5) Create Admin User to your Infoblox Portal Dashboard
===

> [!NOTE]
> Note: Use your Business Email for User Creation

Your user account and sandbox have already been created. The next step is to set up your password and activate your account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NOTE: If your account has already been activated on the Infoblox Portal, please proceed to the password reset steps outlined in Section 2.

### Section 1

1. Please check the inbox of the email account you used to register for the Infoblox Lab.
2. You will receive an email with the subject ‚ÄúInfoblox User Account Activation.‚Äù Open this email and click on the ‚ÄúActivate Account‚Äù button to proceed.
